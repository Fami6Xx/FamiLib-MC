# INFO
This is where i story my ideas for next features

- As you can see I love hurting myself with creating Algorithms :D

## ParticleText
The name practically explains itself. I would want to implement an algorithm which takes a String and outputs a List of Locations for Particles to be placed

## Building visualization
Takes in 2 locations and loops every block inside that selection. Algorithm then decides which blocks are outline of the building and returns List of Locations, or it may instantly visualize them

## Tree procedural generation
An algorithm which creates a realistic looking big trees

## Paginated menus
An API to easily created paginated menus and to handle them
