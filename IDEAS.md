# INFO
This is where I store my ideas for next features

## ParticleText
The name practically explains itself. I would want to implement an algorithm which takes a String and outputs a List of Locations for Particles to be placed

## Building visualization
Takes in 2 locations and loops every block inside that selection. Algorithm then decides which blocks are outline of the building and returns List of Locations, or it may instantly visualize them

## Settings menu
Menu, where you could modify settings of modules
